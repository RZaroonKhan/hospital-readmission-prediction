#Hospital Readmission Predictions

##Predicting 30-Day Hospital Readmissions Using Machine Learning

This project builds a predictive model to identify patients at high risk of being readmitted within 30 days of discharge, using real-world hospital data. The solution includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), with SHAP-based model explainability. Delivered as an interactive Streamlit app for clinicians, plus a Power BI dashboard for hospital leadership.

Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, SHAP), Streamlit, Power BI
