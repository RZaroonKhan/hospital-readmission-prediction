# Hospital Readmission Predictions

## Overview
This project builds a model that predicts whether a patient is at high risk to be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days using electronic health records. The workflow covers **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, hyperparameter tuning, calibration, and deployment** via a Streamlit web app.  

It is designed as an **end-to-end data science & machine learning pipeline** — from raw data → trained ML models → interactive web app.  


## Features
- Data preprocessing & cleaning (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerics).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation.
- Probability calibration for better decision thresholds.
- **Streamlit Web App** for user-friendly predictions.
- Deployment-ready structure (Docker + Makefile included).
- Modular & reproducible code.
